# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the NAD (Núcleo de Acompanhamento de Determinações) Propositions System v2 - a workflow management system for tracking and processing propositions originated from the Brazilian National Prosecution Service's (Ministério Público) correctional inspections.

**Current Status**: Specification and design phase. No implementation code exists yet. The repository contains detailed specifications and workflow documentation.

## Domain Context

### Core Entities

**Proposições (Propositions)**: Central entity representing corrective measures or determinations issued during correctional inspections. Each proposition follows a multi-stage lifecycle with strict persona-based access control.

**Correições (Inspections)**: Parent entity that generates propositions. Represents a correctional inspection conducted by the SCI (Sistema de Correição Integrada) that results in one or more propositions.

### Key Personas and Authorities

The system is **persona-oriented** with strict hierarchical authority:

1. **Corregedor Nacional (National Prosecutor)**: Final decision-making authority. Can create, edit, delete propositions, approve/reject auxiliary member evaluations, and issue binding decisions.

2. **Membro Auxiliar da CN (Auxiliary Member)**: Provides technical evaluations that inform but never produce concrete effects alone. Evaluations are always subject to National Prosecutor approval.

3. **Secretaria Processual da CN (Procedural Secretariat)**: Operational role that creates diligences, manages communications, and tracks administrative fulfillment of provisions.

4. **Correicionado (Inspected Party)**: Submits evidence and compliance documentation.

### Critical Workflow Invariants

**Two-Layer Judgment System**: Every decision has two mandatory layers:
- First layer: `necessita mais informações` (needs more info) or `concluída` (concluded)
- Second layer (only when concluded): `cumprida`, `parcialmente cumprida`, `não cumprida`, `prejudicada - perda de objeto`, `encerrada - sem análise de mérito`

**Evaluation vs Decision**:
- Auxiliary member evaluations NEVER produce concrete effects
- Only the National Prosecutor's decision or "evaluation with decision force" produces effects
- Deferral (approval) adopts all evaluation invariants wholesale
- Rejection requires the National Prosecutor to provide new invariants in the same act

**Provision Control** (`providências`):
- Only `parcialmente cumprida` and `não cumprida` allow additional provisions
- Provisions are **administrative control mechanisms only**
- Provisions are fulfilled **entirely outside the system**
- The system only records: `dataCumprimento` (fulfillment date) and `observações` (observations)
- Common provision types: `encaminhamento de informações à Corregedoria local`, `encaminhamento de informações à COCI`, `outras providências`
- The provision tracking creates a **parallel pending item** that doesn't block the main proposition flow

### Lifecycle Flow

```
SCI Inspection → Migration to NAD → Create/Edit (CN) → Diligence (Secretariat)
→ Evidence (Inspected Party) → Evaluation (Auxiliary Member) → Decision (National Prosecutor)
→ Notification → [Parallel: Provision Tracking if applicable]
```

**Return Loop**: When decision is `necessita mais informações`, the proposition returns to Secretariat for new diligence, restarting the evidence-evaluation-decision cycle.

**Termination**: Decisions marked `concluída` proceed to notification and close the main flow. Parallel provision tracking continues independently if applicable.

## Architecture Principles

### State Management
- `statusFluxo`: Reflects current process phase, NOT the conclusive result
- `juizoAtual`: Holds the conclusive judgment (situation + conclusion type + provision flag)
- `juizoAtual.existeProvidenciaSecretaria`: Only valid when `tipoConclusao` is `parcialmente_cumprida` or `nao_cumprida`

### Audit Trail (`historico`)
- All relevant events must be recorded with full audit trail
- Minimum event types: `criacao`, `edicao`, `apagamento_proposicao`, `criacao_diligencia`, `comprovacao`, `avaliacao_membro_auxiliar`, `decisao`, `avaliacao_com_forca_de_decisao`, `avaliacao_removida_pelo_corregedor`, `cientificacao`, `cumprimento_pendencia_secretaria`
- When evaluation is approved via deferral, both the evaluation AND the decision remain in history with identical invariants
- When evaluation is rejected, both the evaluation AND the divergent decision remain in history
- Removed evaluations are NOT kept as material content; only a removal event (`avaliacao_removida_pelo_corregedor`) is recorded

### Deletion Semantics
- `APAGAR proposição`: Terminates the entire proposition lifecycle
- `APAGAR avaliação`: Removes only the current evaluation, preserves the proposition, allows new auxiliary evaluation or direct decision by National Prosecutor

### Pending Items (`pendenciasSecretaria`)
- Array structure containing parallel administrative tasks
- Each pending item includes: `tipo`, `tipoProvidencia`, `descricao`, `status`, `dataCriacao`, `dataCumprimento`, `observacoes`
- Provisions are informational only - the system does not execute or automate provision fulfillment
- The goal is visibility: which provisions are pending vs completed

## Key Documentation Files

**SPECS.md**: Complete functional specification including data modeling, business rules, state consistency rules, and mandatory scenarios. This is the authoritative source for system behavior.

**passos_do_processo_nad.md**: Step-by-step workflow description organized by persona. Details the exact sequence of actions each actor performs throughout the proposition lifecycle.

**Excalidraw.excalidraw**: Visual architecture diagram (requires Excalidraw to view).

## Important Constraints

1. **Never violate persona authority**: Auxiliary evaluations cannot produce effects. Only National Prosecutor decisions matter.

2. **Preserve invariant structure**: Evaluations and decisions must use identical invariant schema (two-layer judgment + provision flag when applicable).

3. **Honor deletion semantics**: Deleting a proposition vs deleting an evaluation have entirely different consequences.

4. **Maintain audit integrity**: Never remove historical events from material history. Use tombstone events for deletions.

5. **Provision independence**: The main proposition flow never waits for provision fulfillment. Provisions run in parallel and are for administrative tracking only.

6. **State consistency**: `juizoAtual` must respect the rules in SPECS.md:244-253 regarding situation, conclusion type, and provision existence.

## When Implementing

- Start by reviewing both SPECS.md and passos_do_processo_nad.md completely
- The data models in SPECS.md:144-241 should inform database schema design
- Implement persona-based access control from the start
- Enforce state consistency rules at the database/service layer, not just UI
- Build comprehensive audit logging before any business logic
- Test mandatory scenarios listed in SPECS.md:255-263
